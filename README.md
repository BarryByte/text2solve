An AI-powered interactive tutor for Math and Physics that helps users step-by-step—from understanding the problem through hints to revealing the complete solution.

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ **Ask Questions**: Enter any math or physics problem.
- 💡 **Get Hints**: Receive beginner-friendly clues before the solution.
- 🧮 **Step-by-Step Solutions**: Detailed, easy-to-follow answers generated by Gemini.
- 📜 **Conversation History**: Saved and viewable in the sidebar using Firebase Firestore.
- 🔐 **Secure Integration**: API keys and Firebase config managed via Streamlit secrets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) — UI and app framework  
- [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) — AI model for hint and solution generation  
- [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) — Cloud database to store Q&A history  
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) — Backend logic

## 📦 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-solution-tutor.git
   cd text-to-solution-tutor
   ````

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add Streamlit secrets:**

   Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and add your credentials:

   ```toml
   [firebase_credentials]
   type = "..."
   project_id = "..."
   # include the rest of your Firebase service account keys

   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key_here"
   ```

4. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📚 Example Use Case

1. A student types in a physics question like *"What is the acceleration of an object falling from 10 meters?"*
2. The app first returns a hint like:
   *"Think about the formula for free fall: $a = g$, and ignore air resistance."*
3. When the user clicks **Show Solution**, a detailed step-by-step explanation is provided.
4. The full Q\&A is saved to the **sidebar history** for review.
